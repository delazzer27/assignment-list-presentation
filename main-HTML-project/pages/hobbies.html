    <h1> Hobbies </h1>
    <p> I like to do these activities during my free time</p>
    <ul>
        <li> Acting lessons </li>
        <li> Going to the gym </li>
        <li> Watching anime </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2> Acting lessons </h2>
    <p> I've always liked to go to the theater since I was a kid. 
        When I turned 17 I started to take acting lessons. While I act out 
        I can express myself, be creative and pretend to be someone 
        that I'm not. It gives me the possibility to connect with 
        myself and make new friends. I really enjoy these lessons, 
        and luckily I got the chance to perform in some plays and short films. 
        It's really fun and I love it!
    </p>

    <h2> Work out </h2>
    <p> I spend too much time in front of a computer because of my job and my studies. 
        Going to the gym and working out really helps me to be healthy and relax from 
        work. It's a time for myself where I can listen to music, run and do my rutine 
        excercises. I think it is important to have a healthy life, and I also enjoy 
        moving my body since I spend too much time siting on a chair, working and studying!
    </p>

    <h2> Watching anime </h2> 
    <p>
        I'm really a big fan of anime, I've watched them since I was a child. I think 
        I've already watched too many animes, but I can't handle it, I enjoy it so much. 
        Its one of my favourite activities. Here are some of my favourite animes:
        <ul>
            <li> Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood </li>
