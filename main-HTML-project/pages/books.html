    <h2> The Analyst - John Katzenbach </h2>
    <p> Resume: <em> "Happy fifty third birthday, Doctor. Welcome 
        to the first day of your death". </em> Dr. Frederick Starks, 
        a New York psychoanalyst, has just received a mysterious, 
        threatening letter. Now he finds himself in the middle of 
        a horrific game designed by a man who calls himself Rumplestiltskin. 
        The rules: in two weeks, Starks must guess his tormentor's identity. 
        If Starks succeeds, he goes free. If he fails, Rumplestiltskin will 
        destroy, one by one, fifty-two of Dr. Starks' loved ones—unless the 
        good doctor agrees to kill himself. In a blistering race against time, 
        Starks' is at the mercy of a psychopath's devious game of vengeance. 
        He must find a way to stop the madman—before he himself is driven mad. . .  </p>
